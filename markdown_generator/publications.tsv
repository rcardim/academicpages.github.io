2024-06-03	A review on microbiological source attribution methods of human salmonellosis: from subtyping to whole-genome sequencing.	Foodborne pathogens and disease	_Salmonella_ is one of the main causes of human foodborne illness. It is endemic worldwide, with different animals and animal-based food products as reservoirs and vehicles of infection. Identifying animal reservoirs and potential transmission pathways of Salmonella is essential for prevention and control. There are many approaches for source attribution, each using different statistical models and data streams. Some aim to identify the animal reservoir, while others aim to determine the point at which exposure occurred. With the advance of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) technologies, new source attribution models will greatly benefit from the discriminating power gained with WGS. This review discusses some key source attribution methods and their mathematical and statistical tools. We also highlight recent studies utilizing WGS for source attribution and discuss open questions and challenges in developing new WGS methods. We aim to provide a better understanding of the current state of these methodologies with application to _Salmonella_ and other foodborne pathogens that are common sources of illness in the poultry and human sectors.	source-att-salmonella-review	https://doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2023.0075
2022-06-01 	Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 in British Columbia: an age-structured model with time-dependent contact rates	Epidemics	Following the emergence of COVID-19 at the end of 2019, several mathematical models have been developed to study the transmission dynamics of this disease. Many of these models assume homogeneous mixing in the underlying population. However, contact rates and mixing patterns can vary dramatically among individuals depending on their age and activity level. Variation in contact rates among age groups and over time can significantly impact how well a model captures observed trends. To properly model the age-dependent dynamics of COVID-19 and understand the impacts of interventions, it is essential to consider heterogeneity arising from contact rates and mixing patterns. We developed an age-structured model that incorporates time-varying contact rates and population mixing computed from the ongoing BC Mix COVID-19 survey to study transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we fit four versions of our model to weekly reported cases of COVID-19 in BC, with each version allowing different assumptions of contact rates. We show that in addition to incorporating age-specific contact rates and mixing patterns, time-dependent (weekly) contact rates are needed to adequately capture the observed transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Our approach provides a framework for explicitly including empirical contact rates in a transmission model, which removes the need to otherwise model the impact of many non-pharmaceutical interventions. Further, this approach allows projection of future cases based on clear assumptions of age-specific contact rates, as opposed to less tractable assumptions regarding transmission rates.	age-structured-bc-COVID	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2022.100559

2014-09-22	Fragmentation of brittle plates by localized impact	Applied Physics Letters	" We address the fragmentation of thin, brittle layers due to the impact of high-velocity projectiles. Our approach is a geometric statistical one, with lines and circles playing the role of cracks randomly located over the surface and following distributions that come from an analysis of how the energy input propagates and dissipates over the material. The cumulative mass distributions F(m) we obtain are in excellent agreement with the data produced by Kadono [Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 1444 (1997)]. In the small mass regime we get F(m) prop to m^(-alpha) for a broad range of dissipation strengths and total number of fragments. In addition we obtain the fractal dimension of the set of cracks and its correlation to the exponent alpha that account for the experimental results given by Kadono and Arakawa [Phys. Rev. E 65, 035107(R) (2002)]."	fragmentation-plates	http://academicpages.github.io/files/paper3.pdf
