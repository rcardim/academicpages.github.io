I am a CIHR Health System Impact Fellow at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver. I hold a Ph.D. from the Mathematics Department at the University of British Columbia - UBC, under the supervision of Dan Coombs. I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in the Physics Department at Universidade Federal de Pernambuco - UFPE, my hometown university. 

My current research focuses on developing tools to improve surveillance systems and support policy and intervention development, particularly integrating wastewater signals into predictive systems of disease outcomes, with a specific focus on viral respiratory infections.

Applying one health lens, I have developed models for _Salmonella_ transmission within the Poultry chain in BC. Currently, I am focusing on avian flu (HPAI) transmission and spillover risk assessments.
