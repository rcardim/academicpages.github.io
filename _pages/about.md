I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver. I hold a Ph.D. from the Mathematics Department at the University of British Columbia - UBC, under the supervision of Dan Coombs. I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in the Physics Department at Universidade Federal de Pernambuco - UFPE, my hometown university.
