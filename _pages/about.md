I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at British Columbia Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver. I hold a Ph.D. Candidate at the Mathematics Department at the University of British Columbia - UBC, under the supervision of Dan Coombs. My Bachelor's and Master's degree were held at Universidade Federal de Pernambuco - UFPE, my hometown university, in the Physics Department.
