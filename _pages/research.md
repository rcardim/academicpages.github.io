My research interest is in the general field of mathematical biology. My work focuses on new algorithms to analyze single-particle tracks, in particular hidden Markov models and nonparametric models.  
In my research, I use tools from applied probability, Bayesian nonparametric, multi-model inference, and diffusion processes. I am currently working on the inference of the number of Markov states as well as their parameters when measurements are noisy. Moreover, I have also worked on the development of methods to analyze two-colour experimental data of single-particle trajectories of molecules called peptide-MHC on a lipid bilayer with a helper T cell lying over, where both peptide-MHC and T-cell receptors were labelled.

From September 2020 to December  2020, I worked as a researcher from UBC together with MNP's data science team, we developed a model to predict and provide a risk assessment of Covid-19 exposure to businesses. 

From March 2020 to August 2020, I worked as a math modeller at BCCDC on the modelling of the Covid-19 epidemic in BC. We focused on the impact of non-pharmaceuticals interventions such as contact tracing, and physical distancing. I also worked on the design of a model to study the possible vaccination scenarios and their implication on the epidemic curves.

From July 2019 to November 2019, I worked as an intern at Visier. There, I developed an algorithm to clean human resources data, in particular, improving its consistency and its standardization regarding job titles, and functions. 

 In my master,  I worked on the study of fragmentation of a disk by an impact projectile.  Using a statistical model for the cracks, the distribution of the area of the fragments was calculated based on how the energy input propagates and dissipates over the material.
