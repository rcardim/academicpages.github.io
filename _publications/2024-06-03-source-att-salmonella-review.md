title: "A review on microbiological source attribution methods of human salmonellosis: from subtyping to whole-genome sequencing."

permalink: /publication/2024-06-03-source-att-salmonella-review
excerpt: '_Salmonella_ is one of the main causes of human foodborne illness. It is endemic worldwide, with different animals and animal-based food products as reservoirs and vehicles of infection. Identifying animal reservoirs and potential transmission pathways of Salmonella is essential for prevention and control. There are many approaches for source attribution, each using different statistical models and data streams. Some aim to identify the animal reservoir, while others aim to determine the point at which exposure occurred. With the advance of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) technologies, new source attribution models will greatly benefit from the discriminating power gained with WGS. This review discusses some key source attribution methods and their mathematical and statistical tools. We also highlight recent studies utilizing WGS for source attribution and discuss open questions and challenges in developing new WGS methods. We aim to provide a better understanding of the current state of these methodologies with application to _Salmonella_ and other foodborne pathogens that are common sources of illness in the poultry and human sectors.'
